# This test will first verify the DD schema of the currently running
# server, and dump the SHOW CREATE statements for the DD tables to
# a file. Then, it will unzip a data dirctory from each of the
# previous 8.0 versions from which upgrade is supported, restart the
# server to make it do upgrade, and verify that the DD tables after
# upgrade are similar to those that are created when initializing the
# target server.
# 
# The zipped data directories were created on case sensitive file
# systems with lower_case_table_names == 0. There is a corresponding
# test for upgrade from 5.7.
