# WL#9343:  log TNG: log writers
#
#
# This test verifies the interaction with the 'ix syslog.
# It is disabled by default, to be run manually, so we
# won't spam the test host's syslog on a regular and concurrent
# basis. Besides, we'd have to make an unpleasant amount of
# assumptions about where the logs are located, how they're structured,
# and that we had the privileges to access them.
# This test is therefore provided for convenience, but disabled by
# default, and is not expect to pass on all platforms.
