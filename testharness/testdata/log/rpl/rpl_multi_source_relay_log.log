# Verify that the "ch1" and "ch2" channels would copy the global
# replication filters to its own per-channel replication filters
# when they are being created and configured by CHANGE MASTER TO
# ... FOR CHANNEL.
#
# Verify RESET SLAVE and RESET SLAVE FOR CHANNEL
# - deletes all relay log files of named channels and reinitializes
# them.
# - For default channel, it restart the relay log from .000001
# - retains replication filters of the channel.
# - For named channel, it restart the relay log from ch.000001
# - retains all replication filters from all replication channels.
#
# Verify that "'RESET SLAVE ALL FOR CHANNEL '<channel_name>'" removes
# the replication channel specified by 'FOR CHANNEL' clause and all
# replication filters of the channel. There is no effect to other
# channels.
#
# "RESET SLAVE ALL FOR CHANNEL ''" removes the default channel and all
# replication filters of the channel firstly, but then create a new
# default channel which is not configured yet. So performance_schema.
# replication_applier_filters and SHOW SLAVE STATUS do not show it.
#
# Verify that default channel would copy global replication filters
# to its per-channel replication filters if there are no per-channel
# replication filters and there are global replication filters on the
# filter type when it is being configured. Then performance_schema.
# replication_applier_filters and SHOW SLAVE STATUS show it.
#
# Verify that "RESET SLAVE ALL" with no FOR CHANNEL clause removes all
# replication channels, so it shall remove all per-channel replication
# filters but does not touch all global replication filters. When the
# new channel is being configured, it therefore uses the global filters
# (copies all global replication filters to its own per-channel
# replication filters).
