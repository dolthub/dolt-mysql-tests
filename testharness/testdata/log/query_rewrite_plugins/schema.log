# Test of rewrites of queries where the database (a.k.a. schema) is not
# specified in the pattern.
#
# MySQL behaves in the most peculiar way in this respect. Some
# explanation is order here: When a query is parsed, the
# parser injects the current database when parsing a table name, i.e.
# 'table' is _parsed_ as '<current database>.table'.
#
# The session that loads the rules has no current database, so the rule
# has to specify it if there are unqualified table names in the pattern.
