# Demonstrate that WITH RECURSIVE can solve several linear equations.
# Using the well-known Gauss algorithm ("pivot de Gauss" in French).
# Equations:
# 2x+3y+z=7
# 5x-3y+10z=21
# 6x+0y+12z=28
# are described and solved like this:
# call solver("[[2,3,1],  [5,-3,10],  [6,0,12]]", "[7,21,28]");
SET @save_sql_mode=@@sql_mode$
# "||" is nicer and shorter to read than concat():
